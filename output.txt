As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. 
As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.
As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn’t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. 
At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. “Little tyke,” chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. 
But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. 
Chapter 1
For a second, Mr. Dursley didn’t realize what he had seen — then he jerked his head around to look again. 
He didn’t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. 
He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. 
He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn’t know why, but they made him uneasy. 
He got into his car and backed out of number four’s drive.
He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. 
He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. 
He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. 
He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he’d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.
He’d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker’s. 
If he hadn’t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. 
It stared back. 
It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive — no, looking at the sign; cats couldn’t read maps or signs. 
It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar — a cat reading a map. 
Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. 
Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. 
Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. 
Mr. Dursley couldn’t bear people who dressed in funny clothes — the getups you saw on young people! 
Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. 
Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.
Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. 
Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. 
Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. 
Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t met for several years.
None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.
People in cloaks. 
The Boy Who Lived
The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.
The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. 
The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. 
The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. 
The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.
There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight. 
They didn’t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. 
They were the last people you’d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn’t hold with such nonsense.
They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren’t young at all; 
This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing with a child like that.
This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn’t see a single collecting tin. 
What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. 
When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. 
why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt — these people were obviously collecting for something … yes, that would be it.
